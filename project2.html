							<h3>MY CONNECTION </h3>
							<p>
							I remeber going to Pollo Campero at a young age and my parents telling me that Pollo campero is a "wealthy poeple" resturant in Gatemala. They told me that once they were trying to econimize and chose to go to Pollo Campero because another chicken resturant had a long wait time. They told me how the enjoyed their meal until they had to pay. They said they had to either to spend the last bit of money they had or get out of their without beeing noticed. They chose the second option.

				<b> skip out on the dressing </b>
				<p>Most store-bought salad dressings contain vegetable oils (including soybean, canola, and more). Contrary to what the name suggests, these types of oils are far from healthy. Theyâ€™re high in omega-6 fatty acids and lead to inflammation. Plus, most are genetically modified.<p>
